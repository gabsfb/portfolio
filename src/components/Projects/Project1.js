          <p>
          For this project, I was required to design and build a prototype of  MOBA game 
          map from the scratch. I started by sketching out ideas in 
           Krita, using concept art to shape the mapâ€™s overall design and style, ensuring
            it would be both visually engaging and immersive.
          </p>
           <p>Using Blender, I used procedural generation techniques to quickly create a
             variety of assets, ensuring the environment felt rich and dynamic. Once the
              models were complete, I created maps for base color, normals, and lighting, 
              adding style to the scene.</p>
          <p>
          Finally, I brought the map into Unity, where I created custom shaders and 
          materials, fine-tuning every detail to bring the world to life.
           The entire process, from concept to implementation, was completed in 2 months, 
           exhibiting a blend of creativity and technical skills.
